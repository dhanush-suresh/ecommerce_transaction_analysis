# Real-Time Data Processing with Kafka

This project involves the design and implementation of a real-time data processing pipeline using **Kafka** and **Apache Spark** for stream processing. The pipeline is designed to handle e-commerce transaction data in real-time, enabling complex analytics and aggregations. The system leverages **Apache Avro** for efficient data serialization and incorporates **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring and observability.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on processing e-commerce transaction data in real-time. The data is ingested into **Kafka topics** and then consumed by **Apache Spark Streaming** for analysis. Real-time analytics are performed on the data, such as windowed aggregations and stateful processing. The processed data is visualized in **Grafana** dashboards, providing real-time insights into the system performance and transaction metrics.

Key Features:
- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Kafka is used for ingesting and transporting transaction data across multiple producers and consumers.
- **Stream Processing with Apache Spark**: Complex real-time analytics such as aggregations and event processing are performed using Spark Streaming.
- **Efficient Data Serialization**: **Apache Avro** is used for fast and compact serialization of data.
- **Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana**: Real-time metrics, system performance, and data flows are monitored and visualized with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Kafka**: For handling real-time data streams and messaging.
- **Apache Spark**: For stream processing and real-time analytics.
- **Apache Avro**: For efficient data serialization and deserialization.
- **Prometheus**: For monitoring system performance and Kafka/Spark metrics.
- **Grafana**: For real-time visualization of metrics and analytics.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the Kafka, Spark, and Prometheus services for ease of deployment.

## Pipeline Workflow

The data processing pipeline is designed to handle real-time e-commerce transaction data, providing real-time analytics and system observability. Below is the step-by-step workflow of the pipeline:

### 1. **Kafka Producer**:
   - **Role**: The producer simulates and generates e-commerce transaction data, which is then pushed to Kafka topics.
   - **Details**: 
     - The producer creates transaction records such as user activity, purchase data, and product details.
     - These records are sent as messages to Kafka topics for further processing.

### 2. **Kafka Broker**:
   - **Role**: Kafka acts as the middleware, receiving, storing, and distributing transaction data.
   - **Details**: 
     - Kafka stores messages in topics that act as queues.
     - Topics are partitioned to scale horizontally across Kafka brokers, enabling distributed data streaming.
     - Consumers (Spark Streaming) can subscribe to these topics and consume messages in real-time.

### 3. **Apache Spark Streaming**:
   - **Role**: Spark consumes the Kafka topics in real-time and performs analytics on the transaction data.
   - **Details**:
     - Spark Streaming jobs continuously pull data from Kafka and process the incoming data streams.
     - The processing includes:
       - **Windowed Aggregations**: Grouping data by time windows to perform real-time aggregations (e.g., total sales per minute).
       - **Stateful Processing**: Maintaining the state of a stream for computations that depend on previous events.
       - **Complex Transformations**: Performing calculations and filtering on the incoming data streams.
     - The processed data can be written to storage (e.g., databases or data lakes) or visualized directly.

### 4. **Real-Time Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**:
   - **Role**: Prometheus collects metrics from Kafka and Spark, and Grafana visualizes these metrics in real-time.
   - **Details**:
     - **Prometheus**: Continuously scrapes metrics from Kafka and Spark containers to monitor system performance and health.
     - **Grafana**: Displays the collected metrics in interactive dashboards, showing:
       - Kafka metrics: consumer lag, throughput, errors, topic sizes.
       - Spark metrics: job execution time, task completion, resource usage (CPU, memory).
       - System health: CPU usage, memory usage, and container status.
   - Dashboards allow for easy visualization of the data pipelineâ€™s performance and provide insights into potential issues that require attention.
